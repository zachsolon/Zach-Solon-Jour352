    "They don’t respect the culture they’ve created or some of the methods they choose to utilize to become what they’ve become.”
  </blockquote>

  <p>To this point, the public’s understanding of sign stealing mostly rests on anonymous second-hand conjecture and finger-pointing. But inside the game, there is a belief that is treated by players and staff as fact: That illegal sign stealing, particularly through advanced technology, is everywhere. Four people who were with the Astros in 2017, including pitcher Mike Fiers, said that during that season, the Astros stole signs during home games in real time with the aid of a camera positioned in the outfield. Now, an MLB investigation into the Astros’ culture in the wake of the team’s firing of assistant general manager Brandon Taubman could be expanded to determine who in the organization was aware of the sign-stealing practice — and whether it continued or evolved in subsequent seasons. The Athletic’s confirmation of rule-breaking by Houston is limited to 2017.</p>

  <br>

  <p>The Astros of this decade, under owner Jim Crane and general manager Jeff Luhnow, are a polarizing operation. In part, that is due to their success. But it’s also because of how the industry views their modus operandi. The result might be that industry people are simply more willing to discuss Houston than they would be other clubs. “People respect what they’ve accomplished,” one rival general manager said. “They don’t respect the culture they’ve created or some of the methods they choose to utilize to become what they’ve become.”</p>

  <p>Early in the 2017 season, at least two uniformed Astros got together to start the process. One was a hitter who was struggling at the plate and had benefited from sign stealing with a previous team, according to club sources; another was a coach who wanted to help. They were said to strongly believe that some opposing teams were already up to no good.They wanted to devise their own system in Houston. And they did. The Astros’ set-up required technical video knowledge and required the direct aid of at least some on the baseball operations staff, team sources said.</p>

    <p>Pitching for the White Sox in 2017, Danny Farquhar made two mid-September appearances at Minute Maid Park, just before the playoffs. One Astros source recalled that Farquhar appeared to visibly notice what the Astros were up to.

        Farquhar, the source remembered, pointed to his ear on the mound.

          “There was a banging from the dugout, almost like a bat hitting the bat rack every time a changeup signal got put down,” said Farquhar, who is now the pitching coach with the White Sox’s High-A affiliate in Winston-Salem, N.C. “After the third one, I stepped off. I was throwing some really good changeups and they were getting fouled off. After the third bang, I stepped off.”</p>

    <p>Farquhar said he and his catcher changed the signs to the more complex kind used when a runner is on second base — a situation where baserunners have long been able to legally relay signs, using their own eyes.

      “The banging stopped,” Farquhar said. “My assumption was they were picking it up from the video and relaying the signs to the dugout. … That was my theory on the whole thing. It made me very upset. I was so angry, so mad, that the media didn’t come to me after.”</p>

  <blockquote>
    "Or is it because they are, in fact, at the forefront of the problem?"
  </blockquote>

    <br>

    <p>The team should not become the poster child for sign stealing. Not when so much is going on with other clubs that MLB has not stopped, the source said.

    Are the Astros more often a topic because they are disliked by some people around the league, and indeed, by some who walked through their own doors and clubhouse? Or is it because they are, in fact, at the forefront of the problem?

    At this point, the commissioner’s office might need to sort it out. All of it.</p>
